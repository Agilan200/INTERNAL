<p>"Republic of Korea" redirects here. For the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, see North Korea. For the 1919â€“1945 government in exile that used the same name, see Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea.

<p>
 The republic was proclaimed in 1948 and received UN-backed support from the US after it was invaded by the North two years later.

The Korean War ended in 1953 without a peace agreement, leaving South Korea technically at war for more than 70 years.

The following four decades were marked by authoritarian rule, during which government-sponsored schemes encouraged the growth of family-owned industrial conglomerates, including the Hyundai and Samsung groups.

They helped transform South Korea into one of the world's major economies and a leading exporter of cars and electronic goods.
